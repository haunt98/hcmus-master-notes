## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Input -> Conv -> Pooling -> Conv -> Pooling -> Fully Connected -> Output

Pooling (reduce dimension):

- Max pooling: as the filter moves, choose the maximum value
- Average pooling: as the filter moves, choose the average value

Fully Connected (classify based on previous layers)
